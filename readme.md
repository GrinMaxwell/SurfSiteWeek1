## Surf and Paddle Website Layout Assignment

### Task

- The point of this assignment is to exactly recreate a functional front website page from an image using Pixel Perfect
- Good for practicing as a potential job task later, as a design team often give an image and will care exactly where each and every pixel is placed

#### Assets
-  "Comments", "Read Later", and "Share This" asset hints from http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/:
  1. comment signal: fa-comment-o [&#xf0e5;]
  2. share sign: fa-share-square-o [&#xf045;]
  3. read later: fa-cloud-upload [&#xf0ee;]
  4. search magnifying glass: fa-search [&#xf002;], rotated so used fa fa-search fa-rotate-90

Issues, etc.:
  - Had issues with line height, had to make sure it was all set to the same height as the text, which seems like an odd issue to have pop up
